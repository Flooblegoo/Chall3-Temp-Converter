Temperature Converter!

//WILL'S CONDITIONIO SUPREMO - Must be in their own functions (celstofahr() etc.)
//HE ALSO WANTS USER INPUT CHECKING WHICH IS - Don't let typing random shit in break the program, alert them they did the wrong thing then go back to enter again
//Also use decimals not ints for the numbers

int userInputValidate() //This is to call on later for input validation to avoid program ptchk!
//REFER TO userInputValidate.cpp FOR CODE BEFORE COPYING IT ACROSS

int celstofahr()
ensure variables from main() are brought across to play with
request amount of Celsius to convert from user
make conversions as required
print converted amount of Fahrenheit
ask user if they wish to return to menu (1) or exit (2) via the variable user_returntomenu //THIS WILL BE VALIDATED WITH userInputValidate()
if menu then main()
if exit then farewell message and exit safely //try not to use system("pause") even though it doesn't matter because I will never cater to macfags

int fahrtocels()
//This will be exactly the same as celstofahr to the point of copy/pasting the code then just editing as appropriate
//meaning; values for equations, text output and func/variable names

int main() (use as a 'main menu')
Declare variables for entire program and all functions (user_selection, celsius_amount, fahrenheit_amount, user_returntomenu)
using if & else if determine which function to send user to (Celsius to Fahrenheit (celstofahr()) or Fahrenheit to Celsius (fahrtocels()) //THIS WILL BE VALIDATED WITH userInputValidate()
Make a third option to exit program, perhaps
